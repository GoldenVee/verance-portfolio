## About
I'm a software engineer of 2 years with a focus on frontend development with React and Typescript. I have experience building out scalable and accessible products including component libraries. I also have design experience, building start-to-end products. Additionally, I prioritize clear communication, be it verbal or written documentation. Whether it be with a team or alone, I can solve complex problems. If you're interested in adding my skills to the team, lets chat!
